      <description>As PHP grows, more versions show up with better stability &amp;amp; performance, obviously we test our code against production environment, but what if we could test it against new versions with little effort and ensure soft migration ?
Here we will use Docker &amp;amp; Gitlab runners power to ensure that our PHP code runs on those versions: 5.5, 5.6 and 7.0.
We&amp;rsquo;ll use our own Docker images with configured additional extensions not provided by PHP official images, also with installed GIT and newest composer out of the box.</description>

      <description>With this posts I want to highlight few things when staring with GO for new people which sometimes doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem so straight forward after reading https://golang.org/doc/install.
#1 Install GO&amp;rsquo;s version 1.6+ there is no point to use any previous versions as with 1.6 version GO added vendor support (experimental in 1.5). What does it mean ? That dependencies are tight to a project not a global GO&amp;rsquo;s dependency catalog.</description>

      <description>Programmer since 2002 when I wrote my first program in TurboPascal, of course it was a calculator - who would write anything else back then ? Serious programming started around my 1st year at studies when I took my first job - taking care of Polish biggest club portal.
Mostly I code in PHP . Tho I like to code in GO and Python, sometimes in Bash when the hammer is needed.</description>
